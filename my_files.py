# ## Arithmetic Expressions
# In this section, we will demonstrate some basic arithmetic expressions in Python.
# 

# In[3]:


a = 5
b = 3
multiplication = a * b
addition = a + b
multiplication, addition


# In[4]:


minutes = 150
hours = minutes / 60
hours


# ## Objectives
# - Learn about data science languages, libraries, and tools.
# - Perform arithmetic operations.
# - Convert time units (minutes to hours).
